# Job Specification: `maelstrom-pytest.toml`

The file `maelstrom-pytest.toml` in the project directory is used to specify to
`maelstrom-pytest` what job specifications are used for which tests.

This chapter describes the format of that file and how it is used to set the
job spec fields [described here](../spec.md).
