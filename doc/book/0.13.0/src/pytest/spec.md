# Job Specification: `pytest-maelstrom.toml`

The file `pytest-maelstrom.toml` in the [project
directory](../dirs.md#project-directory) is used to specify to `pytest-maelstrom`
what [job specifications](../spec.md)  are used for which tests.

This chapter describes the format of that file and how it is interpreted.
