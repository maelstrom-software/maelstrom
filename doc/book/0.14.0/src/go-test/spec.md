# Job Specification: `maelstrom-go-test.toml`

The file `maelstrom-go-test.toml` in the [project
directory](../dirs.md#project-directory) is used to specify to
`maelstrom-go-test` what [job specifications](../spec.md)  are used for which
tests.

This chapter describes the format of that file and how it is interpreted.
