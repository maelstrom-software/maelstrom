# Job Specification: `cargo-maelstrom.toml`

The file `cargo-maelstrom.toml` in the workspace root is used to specify to
`cargo-maelstrom` what job specifications are used for which tests.

This chapter describes the format of that file and how it is used to set the
job spec fields [described here](../spec.md).
