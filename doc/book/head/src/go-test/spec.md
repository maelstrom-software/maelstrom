# Job Specification: `maelstrom-go-test.toml`

The file `maelstrom-go-test.toml` in the current directory is used to specify
to `maelstrom-go-test` what job specifications are used for which tests.

This chapter describes the format of that file and how it is used to set the
job spec fields [described here](../spec.md).
