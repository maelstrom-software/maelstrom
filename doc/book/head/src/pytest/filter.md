# Test Filter Patterns

There are times when a user needs to concisely specify a set of tests to
`maelstrom-pytest`. One of those is on the command line: `maelstrom-pytest`
can be told to only run a certain set of tests, or to exclude some tests.
Another is the [`filter`](spec/fields.md#filter) field of `maelstrom-pytest.toml`
directives. This is used to choose which tests a directive applies too.

In order to allow users to easily specify a set of tests to `maelstrom-pytest`,
we created the domain-specific pattern language described here.

If you are a fan of formal explanations check out the [BNF](filter-bnf.md).
Otherwise, this page will attempt to give a more informal explanation of the
language.

## Simple Selectors

The most basic patterns are "simple selectors". These are only sometimes useful
on their own, but they become more powerful when combined with other patterns.
Simple selectors consist solely of one of the these identifiers:

Simple Selector      | What it Matches
---------------------|------------------------------
`true`, `any`, `all` | any test
`false`, `none`      | no test

Simple selectors can optionally be followed by `()`. That is, `all()` and
`all` are equivalent patterns.

## Compound Selectors

"Compound selector patterns" are patterns like `name.equals(foo)`. They
combine "compound selectors" with "matchers" and "arguments". In our example,
`name` is the compound selector, `equals` is the matcher, and `foo` is the
argument.

These are the possible compound selectors:

Compound Selector    | Selected Name
---------------------|-------------------------------------------------
`name`               | the name of the test
`file`               | the name of the test's file
`package`            | the name of the test's package
`node_id`            | the name of the test's Pytest "nodeid"

These are the possible matchers:

Matcher       | Matches If Selected Name...
--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------
`equals`      | exactly equals argument
`contains`    | contains argument
`starts_with` | starts with argument
`ends_with`   | ends with argument
`matches`     | matches argument evaluated as regular expression
`globs`       | matches argument evaluated as glob pattern

Compound selectors and matchers are separated by `.` characters. Arguments are
contained within delimiters, which must be a matched pair:

Left | Right
:---:|:----:
`(`  | `)`
`[`  | `]`
`{`  | `}`
`<`  | `>`
`/`  | `/`

Let's put this all together with some examples:

Pattern                                               | What it Matches
------------------------------------------------------|----------------
`node_id.equals(test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method)` | Any test named `"test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method"`.
`file.contains/maelstrom/`                            | Any test in file whose name contains the substring `"maelstrom"`.
`package.matches{(foo)*bar}`                          | Any test whose package name matches the regular expression `(foo)*bar`.

## Markers Selector

The Pytest markers can be used to select tests as well. Each test has a set of
markers associated with it. Using a markers selector, one can select tests that
contain a specific marker. This is basically a compound selector named
`markers` with only one matcher: `contains`.

In this case, `contains` doesn't do substring matching, but instead matches if
the argument is one of the markers for the test.

For example:

Pattern                 | What it Matches
------------------------|----------------
`markers.contains(foo)` | Any test named that has a `foo` marker.
`markers.contains/bar/` | Any test named that has a `bar` marker.

## Compound Expressions

Selectors can be joined together with operators to create compound expressions.
These operators are:

Operators          | Action
-------------------|------------
`!`, `~`, `not`    | Logical Not
`&`, `&&`, `and`   | Logical And
`\|`, `\|\|`, `or` | Logical Or
`\`, `-`, `minus`  | Logical Difference
`(`, `)`           | Grouping

The "logical difference" action is defined as follows: `A - B == A && !B`.

As an example,
to select tests named `foo` or `bar` in package `baz`:
```maelstrom-test-pattern
(name.equals(foo) || name.equals(bar)) && package.equals(baz)
```

As another example, to select tests named `bar` in package `baz` or tests named
`foo` from any package:
```maelstrom-test-pattern
name.equals(foo) || (name.equals(bar) && package.equals(baz))
```

## Abbreviations

Selector and matcher names can be shortened to any unambiguous prefix.

For example, the following are all the same
```maelstrom-test-pattern
name.equals(foo)
name.eq(foo)
n.eq(foo)
```

We can abbreviate `name` to `n` since no other selector starts with "n", but we
can't abbreviate `equals` to `e` because there is another selector, `ends_with`,
that also starts with an "e".
