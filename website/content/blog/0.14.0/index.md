We're excited to announce

release we improved our test runners' GitHub support, as well as fixed some
small bugs and usability issues.

## Improved GitHub Integration

We now have GitHub Actions for all of the Maelstrom binaries. This should make
it much easier to set up Maelstrom in a GitHub workflow.

We also made some improvements in how binaries are configured and how they
connect to each other, which allowed us to greatly simply the provide GitHub
actions. The [updated
documentation](https://maelstrom-software.com/doc/book/latest/github.html)
explains how to set up Maelstrom in GitHub.
